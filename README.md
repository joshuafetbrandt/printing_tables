# printing_tables

### Reason for Project

Printing tables is a curiosity in Python. You see it pretty regularly when you do ```conda update anaconda```, but not much outside of that. 
Here is how you do it Python 3+! The big idea is to use an f-string, and this project is dedicated to the tutorial.
